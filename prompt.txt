I want to make a simple cli app in python that makes quiz questions to prepare for midterm. There should be 2 types of questions (1) Multiple choice questions and (2) Fill in the gaps

I have these nice Lecture Notes from the Sommerville, Software Engineering, 10 ed. by CCSU. This is a page of Chapter 1. I need to make quizzes all throughout ch. 1-12. I searched "CCSU CS 410 Chapter 1" to find it.

Help me make this app. and Give me the code.

My basic idea:
1) Scrape the page with Lecture notes
2) Find a terminology that is noted as bold on a page.
3.1) If it is in the middle of the question, make a fill in the gaps question
3.2) If it is a heading, make the paragraph after it in form of a question and use heading as one of the 4 choices
4) user inputs a word as an answer to fill-in-the-gaps question or one of letters: a,b,c,d as a MCQ question choice
5) Repeat until the end of the quiz
6) Randomize the order of the questions generated
7) Count how many questions were answered right and save it in .txt file where at the top you show the result (e.g. 10/20, 50%) and log of the terminal conversation with a cli

Here is the list of all 12 chapters that should be parsed an quizzed on:

Let's analyze the HTML of the page for Chapter 01 - What is Software Engineering?.
Where to get the title of the quiz:

For MCQ:

<div class="Underhead">
<p>General issues affecting most software</p>
</div>

<dl>
	<dt>Heterogeneity </dt>
	<dd>Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. </dd>

	<dt>Business and social change </dt>
	<dd>Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software.</dd> 
		
	<dt>Security and trust </dt>
	<dd>As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is essential that we can trust that software. </dd>
</dl>

<dt> is a terminalogy and <dd> is a some sort of description for it. div.Underhead > p serves as a <h1> element and encloses a certain domain in given chapter. Let's take an example from the last underhead:

This should generate 3 questions:
1. General issues affecting most software: Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices.
	a) Heterogeneity
	b) Business and social change
	c) Security and trust

2. General issues affecting most software: As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is essential that we can trust that software.
	a) Heterogeneity
	b) Business and social change
	c) Security and trust

3. General issues affecting most software: Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software.

Correct answers: 1.A 2.C 3.B 

Now let's look into how to create fill-in-the-gaps questions:

<div class="Underhead">
<p>Software engineering: a definition</p>
</div>

<p>Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.
It is an <u>engineering discipline</u> because it uses appropriate theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.
Software engineering focuses on <u>all aspects of software production</u> and not just on the technical process of development; it includes project management and the development of tools, methods etc. to support software production.</p>

<p>It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project. For most types of system, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use.</p>


<p>Any software process includes four types of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software <b>specification</b>, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.</li>
<li>Software <b>development</b>, where the software is designed and programmed.</li>
<li>Software <b>validation</b>, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.</li>
<li>Software <b>evolution</b>, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.</li>
</ul>

Here div.Underhead > p serves the same purpose. But we also see <b> that encloses specific term. Example quiz question to create.

1. Software ___, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.

Correct answer: specification.
Note: It should be case insensitive.
