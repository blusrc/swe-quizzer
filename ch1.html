      <p>Why do we need software engineering?</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Software and software systems are everywhere. The economies of ALL
      developed nations are dependent on software. More and more systems are
      software controlled. Software engineering is concerned with theories,
      methods and tools for professional software development. Expenditure on
      software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed
      countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applying software engineering principles helps address the two main
      factors of software failures:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Increasing demands</dt>
      <dd>
        As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more
        complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and
        delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required;
        systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be
        impossible.
      </dd>

      <dt>Low expectations</dt>
      <dd>
        It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using software
        engineering methods and techniques. Computer programming is NOT software
        engineering.

      <p>FAQ about software engineering</p>
    </div>

    <dl>
      <dt>What is software?</dt>
      <dd>
        Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be
        developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general
        market.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are the attributes of good software?</dt>
      <dd>
        Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance
        to the user and should be maintainable, dependable, and usable.
      </dd>

      <dt>What is software engineering?</dt>
      <dd>
        Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with
        all aspects of software production.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are the fundamental software engineering activities?</dt>
      <dd>
        Software specification, software development, software validation and
        software evolution.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        What is the difference between software engineering and computer
        science?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software
        engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and
        delivering useful software.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        What is the difference between software engineering and system
        engineering?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based
        systems development including hardware, software and process
        engineering. Software engineering is part of this more general process.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are the key challenges facing software engineering?</dt>
      <dd>
        Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery times and
        developing trustworthy software.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are the costs of software engineering?</dt>
      <dd>
        Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are testing
        costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development
        costs.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are the best software engineering techniques and methods?</dt>
      <dd>
        While all software projects have to be professionally managed and
        developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types of
        system. For example, games should always be developed using a series of
        prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete
        and analyzable specification to be developed. You can't, therefore, say
        that one method is better than another.
      </dd>

      <dt>What differences has the web made to software engineering?</dt>
      <dd>
        The web has led to the availability of software services and the
        possibility of developing highly distributed service-based systems.
        Web-based systems development has led to important advances in
        programming languages and software reuse.

      <p>Essential attributes of good software</p>
    </div>

    <dl>
      <dt>Maintainability</dt>
      <dd>
        Software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet
        the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute because
        software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business
        environment.
      </dd>

      <dt>Dependability and security</dt>
      <dd>
        Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including
        reliability, security and safety. Dependable software should not cause
        physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Malicious
        users should not be able to access or damage the system.
      </dd>

      <dt>Efficiency</dt>
      <dd>
        Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory
        and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness,
        processing time, memory utilisation, etc.
      </dd>

      <dt>Acceptability</dt>
      <dd>
        Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is
        designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable and
        compatible with other systems that they use.
      </dd>

    <div class="Underhead">
      <p>Software engineering: a definition</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with
      all aspects of software production from the early stages of system
      specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into
      use. It is an <u>engineering discipline</u> because it uses appropriate
      theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and
      financial constraints. Software engineering focuses on
      <u>all aspects of software production</u> and not just on the technical
      process of development; it includes project management and the development
      of tools, methods etc. to support software production.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering
      methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the
      programs as if it was a personal programming project. For most types of
      system, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after
      it has gone into use.
    </p>

    <p>Any software process includes four types of activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Software <b>specification</b>, where customers and engineers define the
        software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software <b>development</b>, where the software is designed and
        programmed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software <b>validation</b>, where the software is checked to ensure that
        it is what the customer requires.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software <b>evolution</b>, where the software is modified to reflect
        changing customer and market requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <p>General issues affecting most software</p>
    </div>

    <dl>
      <dt>Heterogeneity</dt>
      <dd>
        Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems
        across networks that include different types of computer and mobile
        devices.
      </dd>

      <dt>Business and social change</dt>
      <dd>
        Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging
        economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be
        able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new
        software.
      </dd>

      <dt>Security and trust</dt>
      <dd>
        As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is
        essential that we can trust that software.

      <p>Software engineering fundamentals</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      These software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types of
      software system:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Software process</dt>
      <dd>
        Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development
        process. The organization developing the software should plan the
        development process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and
        when it will be completed. Of course, different processes are used for
        different types of software.
      </dd>

      <dt>Focus on reliability</dt>
      <dd>
        Dependability and performance are important for all types of systems.
        Software should behave as expected, without failures and should be
        available for use when it is required. It should be safe in its
        operation and, as far as possible, should be secure against external
        attack. The system should perform efficiently and should not waste
        resources.
      </dd>

      <dt>Importance of requirements</dt>
      <dd>
        Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements
        (what the software should do) are important. You have to know what
        different customers and users of the system expect from it and you have
        to manage their expectations so that a useful system can be delivered
        within budget and to schedule.
      </dd>

      <dt>Leverage software reuse</dt>
      <dd>
        You should make as effective use as possible of existing resources. This
        means that, where appropriate, you should reuse software that has
        already been developed rather than write new software.

      <p>Software engineering ethics</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some issues of professional responsibility:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Confidentiality</dt>
      <dd>
        You should normally respect the confidentiality of your employers or
        clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality
        agreement has been signed.
      </dd>

      <dt>Competence</dt>
      <dd>
        You should not misrepresent your level of competence. You should not
        knowingly accept work that is outside your competence.
      </dd>

      <dt>Intellectual property rights</dt>
      <dd>
        You should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual
        property such as patents and copyright. You should be careful to ensure
        that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
      </dd>

      <dt>Computer misuse</dt>
      <dd>
        You should not use your technical skills to misuse other people's
        computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing
        on an employer's machine, say) to extremely serious (dissemination of
        viruses or other malware).
