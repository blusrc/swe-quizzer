5. Focuses on improving process  and project management and introducing good software engineering practice. 
	The level of process maturity reflects the extent to which good technical and management practice has been 
	adopted in organizational software development processes.
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: a

6. V & V involves checking and review processes and system testing. System testing involves executing the system with test cases that are derived from the specification of the real data to be processed by the system.
Your Answer: c	Correct Answer: c

7. Pre- and post-___, which are statements that are true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced.
Your Answer: b	Correct Answer: conditions (how)

8. Specification, development and validation are interleaved. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version. May be plan-driven or agile.
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: b

9. ___, which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process;
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: Roles (who)

10. Collections of objects that are developed as a ___ to be integrated with a component framework such as .NET or J2EE.
Your Answer: jay	Correct Answer: package

11. Software ___ - checking that it does what the customer wants;
Your Answer: lol	Correct Answer: validation

12. Software is inherently flexible and can change. 
As requirements change through changing business circumstances, the software that supports the business must also evolve and change.
Although there has been a demarcation between development and evolution (maintenance) this is increasingly irrelevant as fewer and fewer systems are completely new.
Your Answer: d	Correct Answer: d

13. Collections of objects that are developed as a ___ to be integrated with a component framework such as .NET or J2EE.
Your Answer: some	Correct Answer: package

14. ___ with incremental development (from the management perspective):
Your Answer: hello	Correct Answer: Problems

15. The main drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. In principle, a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase. Waterfall model ___ include:
Your Answer: hello	Correct Answer: problems

16. ___, which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process;
Your Answer: hello	Correct Answer: Roles (who)

17. ___ of incremental delivery:
Your Answer: lol	Correct Answer: Advantages

18. Software ___ - changing the system in response to changing customer needs.
Your Answer: lol	Correct Answer: evolution

19. Software ___ - defining the organization of the system and implementing the system;
Your Answer: normal	Correct Answer: design and implementation

20. The process is designed so that changes can be accommodated at relatively low cost.
This normally involves some form of incremental development. Proposed changes may be implemented in increments that have not yet been developed. If this is impossible, then only a single increment (a small part of the system) may have be altered to incorporate the change.
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: b

21. Focuses on iterative development and the reduction of overheads in the software process. 
	The primary characteristics of agile methods are rapid delivery of functionality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
Your Answer: b	Correct Answer: b

22. ___, which are the outcomes of a process activity;
Your Answer: hello	Correct Answer: Products (what)

23. Incremental delivery ___:
Your Answer: hello	Correct Answer: problems

24. The software process includes activities that can anticipate possible changes before significant rework is required. 
For example, a prototype system may be developed to show some key features of the system to customers.
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: a

25. ___ processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. 
In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 
In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches.
Your Answer: b	Correct Answer: Plan-driven

26. ___ of incremental development:
Your Answer: a	Correct Answer: Benefits
